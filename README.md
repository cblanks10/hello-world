# hello-world

Hi, my name is Chris. I am looking forward to learning how to become a developer. Im currently taking a coarse online to get started... I have six monthes to test my self to see how far I can get. So lets see.


11/12/18 So far in the last hour I've learned the following:

* Created an open source repository
* Started and managed a new branch
* Changed a file and committed those changes to GitHub
* Opened and merged a Pull Request

 An those bullets though.
